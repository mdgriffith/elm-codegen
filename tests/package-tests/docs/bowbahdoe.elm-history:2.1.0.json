This is meant to provide you with a better idea of what you can effectively use this\nlibrary for. Namely, you can use this data structure to power any feature that fits the pattern of\n\"undo\" and \"redo\".\n\nFor more insights on why you might want to use this data structure, I highly reccomend watching [this talk][1]\n\nIf you are here looking for a way to manage the actual history of a web browser, you should instead\nbe looking at the [elm/Browser][3] package.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure)\n[3]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Navigation#pushUrl\n\n\n# The Data Structure\n\n@docs History\n\n\n# Create\n\n@docs new, fromList\n\n\n# Maneuvering\n\n@docs forward, back, current, to, evolve\n\n\n# Transform\n\n@docs map\n\n",
