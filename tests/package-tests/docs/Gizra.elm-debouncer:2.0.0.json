        "comment": " Ths module allows you to managing inputs that occur over time, so that they\nget handed back to you, at future moments, grouped in a way that you have\nconfigured. Depending on the configuration you provide, you can use this to\nimplemented debouncing, throttling, or other ways of managing inputs that occur\nover time.\n\nThis module provides the most general, comprehensive interface. You can choose:\n\n  - the type of the inputs you provide\n  - the type of the outputs the debouncer will emit\n  - how the debouncer should accumulate inputs to form the output\n  - the times at which outputs will be emitted\n  - what you do with the outputs when you receive them\n\nFor a simpler module that is focused on debouncing or throttling a `Msg`\ntype, see the `Debouncer.Messages` module.\n\nA quick note on terminology: the debouncer is said to be \"unsettled\" while it\nis collecting inputs and considering when to emit output. It becomes \"settled\"\nagain once a specified period has passed without any inputs (see\n`settleWhenQuietFor`).\n\nTo use this module, you will need to integrate it into your `Model` and `Msg`\ntype, and handle it in your `update` function. Here's one example, where the\n\"input\" you're providing is your own `Msg` type, and the output is also your\n`Msg` type. (To avoid some of the verbosity below, you can use the\n`Debouncer.Messages` module).\n\n    import Browser\n    import Debouncer.Basic as Debouncer exposing (Debouncer, fromSeconds, provideInput, settleWhenQuietFor, toDebouncer)\n    import Html exposing (..)\n    import Html.Attributes exposing (..)\n    import Html.Events exposing (..)\n\n    type alias Model =\n        { quietForOneSecond : Debouncer Msg Msg\n        , messages : List String\n        }\n\n    init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )\n    init =\n        ( { quietForOneSecond =\n                Debouncer.manual\n                    |> settleWhenQuietFor (Just <| fromSeconds 1)\n                    |> toDebouncer\n          , messages = []\n          }\n        , Cmd.none\n        )\n\n    type Msg\n        = MsgQuietForOneSecond (Debouncer.Msg Msg)\n        | DoSomething\n\n    update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\n    update msg model =\n        case msg of\n            MsgQuietForOneSecond subMsg ->\n                let\n                    ( subModel, subCmd, emittedMsg ) =\n                        Debouncer.update subMsg model.quietForOneSecond\n\n                    mappedCmd =\n                        Cmd.map MsgQuietForOneSecond subCmd\n\n                    updatedModel =\n                        { model | quietForOneSecond = subModel }\n                in\n                case emittedMsg of\n                    Just emitted ->\n                        update emitted updatedModel\n                            |> Tuple.mapSecond (\\cmd -> Cmd.batch [ cmd, mappedCmd ])\n\n                    Nothing ->\n                        ( updatedModel, mappedCmd )\n\n            DoSomething ->\n                ( { model | messages = model.messages ++ [ \"I did something\" ] }\n                , Cmd.none\n                )\n\n    view : Model -> Html Msg\n    view model =\n        div [ style \"margin\" \"1em\" ]\n            [ button\n                [ DoSomething\n                    |> provideInput\n                    |> MsgQuietForOneSecond\n                    |> onClick\n                ]\n                [ text \"Click here repeatedly.\" ]\n            , p [] [ text \" I'll add a message below once you stop clicking for one second.\" ]\n            , model.messages\n                |> List.map (\\message -> p [] [ text message ])\n                |> div []\n            ]\n\n    main : Program () Model Msg\n    main =\n        Browser.element\n            { init = always init\n            , view = view\n            , update = update\n            , subscriptions = always Sub.none\n            }\n\nBut, remember that you get to choose the types of the inputs and outputs.

        "comment": " Ths module allows you to \"smooth out\" messages over time, so that they\ndon't get applied immediately -- instead, they are applied at a future moment.\nDepending on the configuration you provide, you can use this to implemented\ndebouncing, throttling, or other ways of managing messages.\n\nThis module is simpler than `Debouncer.Basic`, because it is specialized for\nthe common case where the \"input\" is your `Msg` type, and what you ultimately\nwant do do is have the messages applied. You can use `Debouncer.Basic` instead\nif you want to do something more complex.\n\nA quick note on terminology: the debouncer is said to be \"unsettled\" while it\nis collecting inputs and considering when to emit output. It becomes \"settled\"\nagain once a specified period has passed without any inputs (see\n`settleWhenQuietFor`).\n\nTo use this module, you will need to integrate it into your `Model` and `Msg`\ntype, and handle it in your `update` function.

So, the debouncer is basically delaying some messages, according to\nyour configuration.\n\nOur `update` function is simplified (compared to `Debouncer.Basic.update`), so\nthat you can call it (from your update function) like this:\n\n    update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\n    update msg model =\n        case msg of\n            MsgQuietForOneSecond subMsg ->\n                Debouncer.Messages.update update updateDebouncer subMsg model\n\nThis way, you don't have to \"massage\" what our `update` function returns.
