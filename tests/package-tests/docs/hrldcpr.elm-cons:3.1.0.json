        "comment": " This library provides a type for non-empty lists, called `Cons`.\n\nBeing able to encode non-emptiness in the type system can lead to simpler, clearer code.\n\nFor example, to find the largest element in a List, you have to account for the empty list, which complicates things:\n\n    maximum : List comparable -> Maybe comparable\n    maximum l =\n      case l of\n        [] -> Nothing\n        first::rest -> Just <| List.foldl max first rest\n\nUsing Cons, on the other hand, the type system knows the list will never be empty, leading to much simpler code:\n\n    maximum : Cons comparable -> comparable\n    maximum = foldl1 max\n\n\n# Basics\n\n@docs Cons, cons, uncons, singleton, toList, push\n\n\n# Avoiding Maybe\n\nSome functions on Lists are forced to use Maybe to handle the empty list. The following functions are quivalent to their List counterparts, but with no need for Maybe.\n\n@docs head, tail, minimum, maximum\n\n\n# Convenient Folding\n\nFolds over Lists require a start value, but the following fold functions take the start value from the cons.\n\n@docs foldl1, foldr1, scanl1\n\n\n# List May Be Cons\n\nA cons can't be empty, but a `Maybe (Cons a)` can be, if we treat Nothing as empty.\n\nThus `List a` and `Maybe (Cons a)` are completely equivalent, and the following functions let you go back and forth between them.\n\nThis is useful for recursion on Cons. For example, to recursively find the maximum element of a cons:\n\n    maximum : Cons comparable -> comparable\n    maximum c =\n      case unconsWithMaybe c of\n        (first, Nothing) -> first\n        (first, Just rest) -> max first <| maximum rest\n\n@docs fromList, consWithMaybe, unconsWithMaybe, maybeTail, maybeToList, forList\n\n\n# Preserving Non-Emptiness\n\nThe following functions preserve non-emptiness, so given a cons they return a cons.\n\n@docs reverse, append, appendList, appendToList, concat, intersperse, unzip, map, map2, map3, map4, map5, concatMap, indexedMap, scanl, scanlList, sort, sortBy, sortWith\n\n\n# List Functions\n\nEvery function from the List library has been adapted to Cons.\n\nThe following are just convenience functions which convert the cons to a list and then apply the corresponding list function. For example, the definition of `sum` is:\n\n    sum = toList >> List.sum\n\n@docs isEmpty, length, member, filter, take, drop, partition, filterMap, foldl, foldr, sum, product, all, any\n",
