        "comment": " This package provides everything necessary to create spaced repetition software using a variant of the Leitner system. The Leitner system was proposed by Sebastian Leitner in the early 1970s and was originally intended for use with physical (paper) flashcards.\n\nFor the basics about this algorithm, please refer to the [following description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) on Wikipedia.\n\n\n# Settings\n\nThis algorithm requires certain settings be provided when functions are called to specify the behavior of the (very general) system.\n\n@docs LeitnerSettings, OnIncorrect, SpacingFunction, doubleSpacing, fibonacciSpacing, numberOfBoxes\n\n\n# Cards and Decks\n\nThe building blocks of this package are `Card`s and `Deck`s. In simple terms, a `Card` may be thought of as a single flashcard and a `Deck` as a list or collection of `Card`s.\n\n@docs Card, Deck\n\n\n# Card Data\n\nA `Card` may be created by use of the `newSRSData` function, as in the following example:\n\n    type alias MyFlashcard =\n        Card { prompt : String, answer : String }\n\n    myFlashcard : MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcard =\n        { prompt = \"SYN\"\n        , answer = \"SYN-ACK\"\n        , srsData = newSRSData\n        }\n\n@docs SRSData, newSRSData\n\n\n# Json Encoders/Decoders\n\nSince `Card` data must necessarily be preserved between sessions, a Json encoder/decoder is provided for `SRSData`. It may be utilized as follows:\n\n    import Json.Decode as Decode\n    import Json.Encode as Encode\n\n    type alias MyFlashcard =\n        Card { prompt : String, answer : String }\n\n    myFlashcardConstructor : SRSData -> String -> String -> MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcardConstructor srsData prompt answer =\n        { prompt = prompt\n        , answer = answer\n        , srsData = srsData\n        }\n\n    myFlashcardToJson : MyFlashcard -> String\n    myFlashcardToJson myCard =\n        Encode.encode 0 <|\n            Encode.object\n                [ ( \"srsData\", encoderSRSData myCard.srsData )\n                , ( \"prompt\", Encode.string myCard.prompt )\n                , ( \"answer\", Encode.string myCard.answer )\n                ]\n\n    myFlashcardDecoder : Decode.Decoder MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcardDecoder =\n        Decode.map3 myFlashcardConstructor\n            (Decode.field \"srsData\" decoderSRSData)\n            (Decode.field \"prompt\" Decode.string)\n            (Decode.field \"answer\" Decode.string)\n\n    jsonToMyFlashcard : String -> Result Decode.Error MyFlashcard\n    jsonToMyFlashcard str =\n        Decode.decodeString myFlashcardDecoder str\n\n@docs encoderSRSData, decoderSRSData\n\n\n# Answering Cards\n\nThe Leitner system depends only on answers being \"correct\" or \"incorrect.\" Nevertheless, answers are additionally provided for \"manually\" moving cards, e.g. if you wish to implement a system in which the user decides how to move the card (this is usually a bad idea, since the point of an SRS system is to schedule cards better than people are able to estimate themselves).\n\n@docs Answer, answerCardInDeck, answerCard\n\n\n# Due Cards\n\nBesides answering cards, this package handles determining which cards in a `Deck` are due and require study.\n\n@docs getDueCardIndices, getDueCardIndicesWithDetails\n\n\n# Card Details\n\nIf you require specific details for a single card, you may use the provided functionality here. If you need details for _all_ due cards, just use `getDueCardIndicesWithDetails`.\n\n@docs QueueDetails, getCardDetails\n\n",

The card will simply go in the first box or graduate if the provided `Int` results in a new box less than zero or greater than the number of boxes. `MoveBoxes 0` is identical to `Pass`. `BackToFirstBox` resets the card fully and begins learning anew.\n",

Anki's algorithm is a heavily-modified version of the SM-2 algorithm, which has been released for free public use when accompanied by the following notice:\n\n**Algorithm SM-2, (C) Copyright SuperMemo World, 1991.**\n\n  - <http://www.supermemo.com>\n  - <http://www.supermemo.eu>\n\nFor details about Anki's algorithm, please refer to [the following section of its manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#what-spaced-repetition-algorithm-does-anki-use).\n\nThe above description details how Anki's algorithm differs from the SM-2 algorithm, but briefly, the following differences may be noted:\n\n  - SM-2 defines an initial interval of 1 day then 6 days, whereas Anki's algorithm allows for customization of these initial intervals.\n\n  - Anki's algorithm uses 4 choices (3 during learning) for answering cards, not 6.\n\n  - Answering cards later than scheduled will be factored into the next interval calculation.\n\n  - Failing a review card may cause behavior besides fully resetting it (if desired).\n\n  - \"Easy\" answer choice increases the next interval in addition to ease/E-factor.\n\n  - Successive failures while cards are in learning do not result in further decreases to the card’s ease.\n\n\n# Settings\n\nThis algorithm requires certain settings be provided when functions are called to specify the behavior of the system. A builder pattern is available for creating settings with defaults.\n\n@docs AnkiSettings, createSettings, setNewSteps, setGraduatingInterval, setEasyInterval, setStartingEase, setEasyBonus, setIntervalModifier, setMaximumInterval, setHardInterval, setLapseSteps, setLapseNewInterval, setLapseMinimumInterval, setLeechThreshold\n\n\n# Cards and Decks\n\nThe building blocks of this package are `Card`s and `Deck`s. In simple terms, a `Card` may be thought of as a single flashcard and a `Deck` as a list or collection of `Card`s.\n\n@docs Card, Deck\n\n\n# Card Data\n\nA `Card` may be created by use of the `newSRSData` function, as in the following example:\n\n    type alias MyFlashcard =\n        Card { prompt : String, answer : String }\n\n    myFlashcard : MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcard =\n        { prompt = \"SYN\"\n        , answer = \"SYN-ACK\"\n        , srsData = newSRSData\n        }\n\n@docs SRSData, newSRSData\n\n\n# Json Encoders/Decoders\n\nSince `Card` data must necessarily be preserved between sessions, a Json encoder/decoder is provided for `SRSData`. It may be utilized as follows:\n\n    import Json.Decode as Decode\n    import Json.Encode as Encode\n\n    type alias MyFlashcard =\n        Card { prompt : String, answer : String }\n\n    myFlashcardConstructor : SRSData -> String -> String -> MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcardConstructor srsData prompt answer =\n        { prompt = prompt\n        , answer = answer\n        , srsData = srsData\n        }\n\n    myFlashcardToJson : MyFlashcard -> String\n    myFlashcardToJson myCard =\n        Encode.encode 0 <|\n            Encode.object\n                [ ( \"srsData\", encoderSRSData myCard.srsData )\n                , ( \"prompt\", Encode.string myCard.prompt )\n                , ( \"answer\", Encode.string myCard.answer )\n                ]\n\n    myFlashcardDecoder : Decode.Decoder MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcardDecoder =\n        Decode.map3 myFlashcardConstructor\n            (Decode.field \"srsData\" decoderSRSData)\n            (Decode.field \"prompt\" Decode.string)\n            (Decode.field \"answer\" Decode.string)\n\n    jsonToMyFlashcard : String -> Result Decode.Error MyFlashcard\n    jsonToMyFlashcard str =\n        Decode.decodeString myFlashcardDecoder str\n\nA Json encoder/decoder is also provided for `AnkiSettings`, since a `Deck`'s settings must be preserved between sessions.\n\n@docs encoderSRSData, decoderSRSData, encoderAnkiSettings, decoderAnkiSettings\n\n\n# Answering Cards\n\nThe SM-2 Anki algorithm depends on grading answers on a scale with one incorrect and three correct responses, except during the learning phase, in which case only 1 incorrect and two correct responses should be used.

                "comment": " `AnkiSettings` customizes the behavior of this algorithm. Refer to [this section of the Anki manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#deck-options) for more details. It may be created with the `createSettings` function and its values may be changed form default by piping to the following functions:\n\n\n## New Cards\n\n  - `setNewSteps : List Int -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: [1, 10]** Sets the interval steps (in minutes) that a card must go through while in the learning process. Answering `Again` or `Hard` will return a card to step 0. Answering `Easy` will instantly graduate a card. Answering `Good` will advance the card 1 step. If this list is empty, cards will instantly graduate the first time they are reviewed, regardless of the `Answer`. Note that an interval must be at least 1 minute long; any value less than 1 minute will result in an interval of 1 minute.\n\n  - `setGraduatingInterval : Int -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 1** Sets the initial interval (in days) a card will be scheduled for upon graduating from the learning phase. If `newSteps` is empty, all new cards will be scheduled for this interval when first encountered, regardless of answer. Note that this interval will not be fuzzed, per Anki's source. Values less than 1 will result in 1 being used.\n\n  - `setEasyInterval : Int -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 4** Sets the initial interval (in days) a card will be scheduled for upon instantly graduating from the learning phase with an answer of `Easy`. This value is not used if `newSteps` is empty. Note that this interval will not be fuzzed, per Anki's source. Values less than 1 will result in 1 being used.\\`\n\n  - `setStartingEase : Float -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 2.5** Sets the initial ease that a card graduating from learning will have. Values less than 1.3 are ignored and result in 1.3 being used instead (as that is the minimum ease a card may have).\n\n\n## Reviews\n\n  - `setEasyBonus : Float -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default 1.3** Sets the multiplier for the next interval of a card that was answered `Easy` (i.e. additional interval length over merely answering `Good`. Values less than 1.0 are ignored.\n\n  - `setIntervalModifier : Float -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default 1.0** Set the multiplier for **all** intervals, e.g. setting it to 0.8 will result in all review intervals being 80% as long as they would normally be. This multiplier may be used to increase/decrease retention at the cost of increasing/decreasing study time, respectively. Values less than or equal to zero are ignored.\n\n  - `setMaximumInterval : Int -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 36500** Set the upper limit on the time the algorithm will schedule a card for (in days). Small values may be used to cap time between seeing a card (to increase retention). Values less than 1 are ignored. Note that, due to the limitations of integers, an absolute maximum interval of 1491308 days (4085 years) exists. Since you almost certainly won't be alive in 4000 years to study a card, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\n  - `setHardInterval : Float -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 1.2** Set the multiplier applied to the previous interval when `Hard` is answered to a card. Note that intervals are forced to be at least 1 day longer than the previous one (before fuzzing). As such, values <= 1 will have no effect. Additionally, values of `hardInterval` that would result in a longer interval than that from answering `Good` (i.e. that are larger than the ease of the card) are ignored, with ease being used instead. As such, it is probably good practice to keep this value <= 1.3, as that is the lower limit on ease.\n\n\n## Lapses\n\n  - `lapseSteps : List Int -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: [10]** Set the interval steps (in minutes) that a card must go through while relearning after a lapse. Answering `Again` or `Hard` will return a card to step 0. Answering `Easy` will instantly graduate a card back to review. Answering `Good` will advance the card 1 step. If this list is empty, cards will instantly graduate the first time they are reviewed, regardless of the `Answer`.\n  - `lapseNewInterval : Float -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 0.0** Set a multiplier for the pre-lapse interval to determine the new interval after graduating a card back from re-learning. Values less than 0.0 are ignored Note that this interval is not fuzzed, per Anki's source.\n  - `lapseMinimumInterval : Int -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 1** Set a minimum bound on the previous option, with lapsed cards getting a new interval of at least this value. Answers less than 1 are ignored.\n  - `leechThreshold : Int -> AnkiSettings -> AnkiSettings` -- **Anki default: 8** Set the number of lapses before a card is considered a \"leech.\" `getDueCardIndices` will return the leech status of each card in the deck. Additionally, `getLeeches` will return all leeches in a deck (regardless of due status). Setting this value to less than or equal to 0 turns off leeches entirely.\n\n",

        "comment": " This package provides everything necessary to create spaced repetition software using the SM2+ algorithm. The SM2+ algorithm was proposed by \"BlueRaja\" as an improvement of the SM-2 algorithm, which has been released for free public use when accompanied by the following notice:\n\n**Algorithm SM-2, (C) Copyright SuperMemo World, 1991.**\n\n  - <http://www.supermemo.com>\n  - <http://www.supermemo.eu>\n\nFor details about the SM2+ algorithm and its purported advantages over the SM-2 algorithm, please refer to the [following blog post](http://www.blueraja.com/blog/477/a-better-spaced-repetition-learning-algorithm-sm2).\n\n**It should be noted that this algorithm produces seemingly illogical behavior, namely that more incorrect answers result in longer intervals than less incorrect answers. Do not use it if this behavior is objectionable to you (as it probably should be).** A custom scheduling function for incorrect answers may be provided if one still wishes to use it (with a different incorrect scheduler).\n\nMost notably (versus SM-2), the SM2+ algorithm \"rewards\" correctly answering more-overdue cards and sorts due items based on the proportion they are overdue, not the absolute amount they are overdue by. Additionally, the initial intervals are 1 day -> 3 days, rather than 1 day -> 6 days.\n\n\n# Cards and Decks\n\nThe building blocks of this package are `Card`s and `Deck`s. In simple terms, a `Card` may be thought of as a single flashcard and a `Deck` as a list or collection of `Card`s.\n\n@docs Card, Deck\n\n\n# Card Data\n\nA `Card` may be created by use of the `newSRSData` function, as in the following example:\n\n    type alias MyFlashcard =\n        Card { prompt : String, answer : String }\n\n    myFlashcard : MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcard =\n        { prompt = \"SYN\"\n        , answer = \"SYN-ACK\"\n        , srsData = newSRSData\n        }\n\n@docs SRSData, newSRSData\n\n\n# Json Encoders/Decoders\n\nSince `Card` data must necessarily be preserved between sessions, a Json encoder/decoder is provided for `SRSData`. It may be utilized as follows:\n\n    import Json.Decode as Decode\n    import Json.Encode as Encode\n\n    type alias MyFlashcard =\n        Card { prompt : String, answer : String }\n\n    myFlashcardConstructor : SRSData -> String -> String -> MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcardConstructor srsData prompt answer =\n        { prompt = prompt\n        , answer = answer\n        , srsData = srsData\n        }\n\n    myFlashcardToJson : MyFlashcard -> String\n    myFlashcardToJson myCard =\n        Encode.encode 0 <|\n            Encode.object\n                [ ( \"srsData\", encoderSRSData myCard.srsData )\n                , ( \"prompt\", Encode.string myCard.prompt )\n                , ( \"answer\", Encode.string myCard.answer )\n                ]\n\n    myFlashcardDecoder : Decode.Decoder MyFlashcard\n    myFlashcardDecoder =\n        Decode.map3 myFlashcardConstructor\n            (Decode.field \"srsData\" decoderSRSData)\n            (Decode.field \"prompt\" Decode.string)\n            (Decode.field \"answer\" Decode.string)\n\n    jsonToMyFlashcard : String -> Result Decode.Error MyFlashcard\n    jsonToMyFlashcard str =\n        Decode.decodeString myFlashcardDecoder str\n\n@docs encoderSRSData, decoderSRSData\n\n\n# Answering Cards\n\nThe SM2+ algorithm depends on grading answers on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, with answers of 0.6 and above being correct (and incorrect below that) responses. For some use cases, it may be able to programmatically determine the `PerformanceRating` of a user's response. In other cases, however, the user may need to self-report.\n\n@docs PerformanceRating, performanceRating, answerCardInDeck, answerCard, IncorrectSchedulingFunction, oneMinusReciprocalDiffWeightSquared\n\n\n# Due Cards\n\nBesides answering cards, this package handles determining which cards in a `Deck` are due and require answering.\n\n@docs getDueCardIndices, getDueCardIndicesWithDetails\n\n\n# Card Details\n\nIf you require specific details for a single card, you may use the provided functionality here. If you need details for _all_ due cards, just use `getDueCardIndicesWithDetails`.\n\n@docs QueueDetails, getCardDetails\n\n",
