In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.\n\nThe implementation we provide here is based on Okasaki's _leftist heaps_. See [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf) for more information.\n\n\n# Priority\n\nThroughout this package `priority` will mean a function that assigns a integer value to an element. Lower values indicate higher priority and vice versa.\n\n\n# Types\n\n@docs PriorityQueue, Priority\n\n\n# Building\n\n@docs empty, insert, fromList\n\n\n# Query\n\n@docs head, tail, take, drop, isEmpty\n\n\n# Conversion\n\n@docs toList\n\n",
