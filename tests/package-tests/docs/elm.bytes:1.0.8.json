For example, the letter `j` is usually\nrepresented as the byte `01101010`, and the letter `k` is `01101011`.\n\nSeeing each byte as a stream of zeros and ones can be quite confusing though,\nso it is common to use hexidecimal numbers instead:\n\n```\n| Binary | Hex |\n+--------+-----+\n|  0000  |  0  |\n|  0001  |  1  |\n|  0010  |  2  |\n|  0011  |  3  |     j = 01101010\n|  0100  |  4  |         \\__/\\__/\n|  0101  |  5  |           |   |\n|  0110  |  6  |           6   A\n|  0111  |  7  |\n|  1000  |  8  |     k = 01101011\n|  1001  |  9  |         \\__/\\__/\n|  1010  |  A  |           |   |\n|  1011  |  B  |           6   B\n|  1100  |  C  |\n|  1101  |  D  |\n|  1110  |  E  |\n|  1111  |  F  |\n```\n\nSo `j` is `6A` and `k` is `6B` in hexidecimal. This more compact representation\nis great when you have a sequence of bytes. You can see this even in a short\nstring like `\"jazz\"`:\n\n```\nbinary                                 hexidecimal\n01101010 01100001 01111010 01111010 => 6A 61 7A 7A\n```\n\nAnyway, the point is that `Bytes` is a sequence of bytes!\n",

                "comment": " Different computers store integers and floats slightly differently in\nmemory. Say we have the integer `0x1A2B3C4D` in our program. It needs four\nbytes (32 bits) in memory. It may seem reasonable to lay them out in order:\n\n```\n   Big-Endian (BE)      (Obvious Order)\n+----+----+----+----+\n| 1A | 2B | 3C | 4D |\n+----+----+----+----+\n```\n\nBut some people thought it would be better to store the bytes in the opposite\norder:\n\n```\n  Little-Endian (LE)    (Shuffled Order)\n+----+----+----+----+\n| 4D | 3C | 2B | 1A |\n+----+----+----+----+\n```\n\nNotice that **the _bytes_ are shuffled, not the bits.** It is like if you cut a\nphoto into four strips and shuffled the strips. It is not a mirror image.\nThe theory seems to be that an 8-bit `0x1A` and a 32-bit `0x0000001A` both have\n`1A` as the first byte in this scheme. Maybe this was helpful when processors\nhandled one byte at a time.\n\n**Most processors use little-endian (LE) layout.** This seems to be because\nIntel did it this way, and other chip manufactures followed their convention.\n**Most network protocols use big-endian (BE) layout.** I suspect this is\nbecause if you are trying to debug a network protocol, it is nice if your\nintegers are not all shuffled.\n\n**Note:** Endianness is relevant for integers and floats, but not strings.\nUTF-8 specifies the order of bytes explicitly.\n\n**Note:** The terms little-endian and big-endian are a reference to an egg joke\nin Gulliver's Travels. They first appeared in 1980 in [this essay][essay], and\nyou can decide for yourself if they stood the test of time. I personally find\nthese terms quite unhelpful, so I say “Obvious Order” and “Shuffled Order” in\nmy head. I remember which is more common by asking myself, “if things were\nobvious, would I have to ask this question?”\n\n[essay]: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt\n",

Read more\nabout [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) to learn the details!\n\nBut if you just encode UTF-8 directly, how can you know when you get to the end\nof the string when you are decoding?

(The\nSQLite encoding has the benefit that the first byte tells you how long the\nnumber is, making it faster to decode.) In both cases, it is sort of tricky\nto make negative numbers small.\n",
