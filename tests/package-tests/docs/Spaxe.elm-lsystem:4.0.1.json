        "comment": " Implementation of a L-System.\n\nL-Systems are algorithms originally developed to simulate plants, now\nwidely adopted by the generative geometry community.\n\nThe core concept of a L-system is to rewrite states based on a previous state,\nusing a set of user-defined rules. For example:\n\n    type State\n        = A\n        | B\n\n    rule : LSystem.Rule State\n    rule state =\n        case state of\n            A ->\n                [ A, B ]\n\n            B ->\n                [ A ]\n\nThe result is concatentated after applying the rules to each state in the list.\nIf we start with the state `[A]` and apply the rule a few times, we would have:\n\n`[A]` => `[A, B]`\n\n`[A, B]` => `[A, B, A]`\n\n`[A, B, A]` => `[A, B, A, A, B]`\n\nSo why is this useful for generative graphics? As it turns out, L-System states\ncan be thought of as drawing commands. Here is an example of a \"turtle graphics\nsystem\":\n\n    type State\n        = D -- | Draw forward by 1 unit\n        | S -- | Skip foward 1 unit without drawing\n        | L -- | Turn left by 90 degrees\n        | R -- | Turn right by 90 degrees\n\n    rule : LSystem.Rule State\n    rule state =\n        case state of\n            D ->\n                [ D, D, R, D, L, D, R, D, R, D, D ]\n\n            S ->\n                [ S ]\n\n            L ->\n                [ L ]\n\n            R ->\n                [ R ]\n\nExperiment with the starting state `[D, R, D, R, D, R, D]`, which draws a\nsquare, you can try it out by pen and paper, and see that the rule draws a more\ninteresting square with rectangles within. You can see an example of the above\nafter applying the rule 3 iterations [here](https://twitter.com/Xavier_Ho/status/995651719064252416).\n\nIf you want a complete example of how this can be used in the Elm Architecture,\nsee <https://github.com/creative/elm-generative/blob/master/example/Turtle.elm>\n\nIf you are after a very comprehrensive and dense introductory textbook,\n[The Algorithm Beauty of Plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf)\nis a great introduction.\n\n\n## DOL-Systems\n\nDOL-Systems are a subset of L-Systems. It is the simplest type of a L-System,\nand it stands for \"determinstic, out-of-context L-Systems\". In other words, it\nwill always yield the same result regardless of outside state.\n\n\n# Module functions\n\n@docs Rule, apply\n\n",
