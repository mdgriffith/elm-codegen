The `RawRequest` type is a\nworkaround for that, allowing you to work with the parts of a request.\n\nYou can construct a `RawRequest` manually, by filling in its parts. The various parts\nhave the same meaning as the parameters to [`Http.request`](/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#request).\n\n    req : RawRequest String\n    req =\n        { method = \"GET\"\n        , headers = [ header \"X-Test-Header\" \"Foo\" ]\n        , url = \"http://elm-lang.org\"\n        , body = Http.emptyBody\n        , expect = Http.expectString\n        , timeout = Nothing\n        , withCredentials = False\n        }\n\nAlternatively, you can construct a `RawRequest` by using [`defaultGet`](#defaultGet),\n[`defaultGetString`](#defaultGetString), or [`defaultPost`](#defaultPost) to fill in\nsome defaults. These functions are like [`Http.get`](/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#get),\n[`Http.getString`](/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#getString) and\n[`Http.post`](/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#post), except that they return a\n`RawRequest` which you can further customize, rather than an opaque\n[`Request`](/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#Request).\n\n    req : RawRequest String\n    req =\n        let\n            default =\n                defaultGetString \"http://elm-lang.org\"\n        in\n        { default | headers = [ header \"X-Test-Header\" \"Foo\" ] }\n\nOnce you have a `RawRequest`, you can use [`toRequest`](#toRequest) to turn it into a\n[`Request`](/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#Request) that the `Http` module can use.\nAlternatively, you can [`sendRaw`](#sendRaw) or\n[`toTaskRaw`](#toTaskRaw) to turn the `RawRequest` directly into a `Cmd` or `Task`.\n\n",
