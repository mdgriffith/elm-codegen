For instance, if you are looking at Elm code in\nyour IDE and want to lookup the definition of a function, an empty documentation will give you no information beyond the\ntype annotation.\n\nWhen I write documentation for a module, I try to tell a story or somehow phrase it as a tutorial, so that people can\nlearn the easier concepts first, and gradually as they read more and learn more about the ideas and concepts, I will\nassume that they read most of the documentation above.\n\nBut for every function or type, I also imagine that they'll be read on their own from an IDE for instance, and therefore\ntry to make the documentation as light as possible while giving a helpful description and an example, without relying\ntoo much on the assumption that the user has read the rest of the module.\n\nA common case where people don't give an example is when exposing functions such as `map2`, `map3`, `map4`, etc., usually\ndocumented in that order and next to each other. While `map2` is usually properly documented, the following ones would\nhave empty documentation, which I believe would be because the author assumes that the user went through the documentation on\nthe package registry and has read the documentation for `map2`. But if someone unfamiliar with Elm or an API looks up\n`map3`, they may have trouble finding the information they were looking for.\n\nI would recommend to make the documentation for each element as understandable out of context as possible. At the very least,\nI would advise to say something like \"This function is like `map2` but with X arguments\" with a link to `map2`, so that\nrelevant information _can_ be found without too much effort.\n\n\n## Success\n\n    {-| someFunction does great things\n    -}\n    someFunction =\n        great Things\n\n",
