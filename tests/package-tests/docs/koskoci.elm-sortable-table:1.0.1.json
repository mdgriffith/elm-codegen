This way you are free to change your data without worrying about the table\n&ldquo;getting out of sync&rdquo; with the data. Having a single source of\ntruth is pretty great!\n\nI recommend checking out the [examples] to get a feel for how it works.\n\n[examples]: https://github.com/billstclair/elm-sortable-table/tree/master/examples\n\n\n# View\n\n@docs view\n\n\n# Configuration\n\n@docs config, stringColumn, intColumn, floatColumn\n\n\n# State\n\n@docs State, initialSort\n@docs getSortState, sortBy\n\n\n# Sorted Data Access\n\n@docs getSortedData\n\n\n# Crazy Customization\n\nIf you are new to this library, you can probably stop reading here.
