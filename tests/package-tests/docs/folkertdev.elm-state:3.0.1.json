        "comment": " This library provides ways to compose functions of the type\n`s -> (a, s)`. This composition threads state through a computation\n\nFrom time to time, you'll see a pattern like this in your code\n\n    ( newValue, newState ) =\n        f state\n\n    ( newerValue, newerState ) =\n        g newValue newState\n\n    ( newererValue, newererState ) =\n        h newerValue newerState\n\nThis pattern is ugly and error-prone (because of typo's, for instance).\nIt can be abstracted by creating a function that composes `f` and `g` (\nthe output of `f` is the input to `g`).\n\n    f : s -> ( a, s )\n\n    g : a -> s -> ( a, s )\n\nThis library implements this composition and provides a bunch of helper functions for\nworking with State. For a more in-depth explanation of how the implementation works,\nsee the [derivation](https://github.com/folkertdev/elm-state#derivation). For more detailed, higher\nlevel documentation, please see the [readme](https://github.com/folkertdev/elm-state) and the [examples](https://github.com/folkertdev/elm-state/tree/master/examples)\n\n#Type and Constructors\n\n@docs State, state, embed, advance\n\n#Mapping\n\n@docs map, map2, map3\n\n#Chaining\n\n@docs andMap, andThen, join\n\n#Changing State\n\n@docs get, put, modify\n\n#Running State\n\n@docs run, finalValue, finalState\n\n#Generalized list functions\n\n@docs traverse, combine, filterM, foldlM, foldrM\n\n#Safe recursion\n\nThe archetypal Haskell implementation for State will overflow the stack in strict languages like Elm.\nWe use the fact that elm performs tail-call eliminiation to make sure the generalized list functions don't overflow the stack.\n\nTo allow for full flexibility, the stack-safety primitives are exposed. Look at the source for examples.\n\nThe implementation of these functions is heavily based on the\n[purescript MonadRec implementation](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-tailrec/blob/master/src/Control/Monad/Rec/Class.purs)\n\n@docs tailRec, tailRecM, Step\n\n#Notes for the Haskellers/curious\n\nThe `State` type of this package is the `State Monad`. This wording is a little weird, it'd be better to say that\n`State` is a `Monad`.\n\nMonad is a concept from a branch of mathematics called category theory. In short, it is a type on which\n`andThen` is defined (examples in core are Random, Maybe, Result and Decoder). Many useful types are monads,\nand therefore being familiar with the concept can be very helpful in functional programming.\n\nMonads are also called 'computation builders': They allow for an elegant way of chaining computations with `andThen`\n(see the [README](https://github.com/folkertdev/elm-state#structuring-computation-with-andthen)).\nElm wants to be a simple, easy to learn language, and therefore monads aren't really talked about (yet). I've tried to limit the jargon in the documentation to a minimum.\nIf anything in the docs here or in the repository is still unclear, please open an issue [on the repo](https://github.com/folkertdev/elm-state/issues).\n\n",
