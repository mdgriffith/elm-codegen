With normal HTTP you would have to\n    keep _asking_ for changes, but a web socket, the server can talk to you\n    whenever it wants. This means there is less unnecessary network traffic.\n\n\n# Web Sockets\n\n\n## Types\n\n@docs State, Message, Response, Error, ClosedCode, JSVersion\n\n\n## Components of a `PortFunnel.FunnelSpec`\n\n@docs moduleName, moduleDesc, commander\n\n\n## Initial `State`\n\n@docs initialState\n\n\n## Creating a `Message`\n\n@docs makeOpen, makeSend, makeClose\n@docs makeOpenWithKey, makeKeepAlive, makeKeepAliveWithKey\n\n\n## Sending a `Message` out the `Cmd` Port\n\n@docs send\n\n\n# Conversion to Strings\n\n@docs toString, toJsonString, errorToString, closedCodeToString\n\n\n# Simulator\n\n@docs makeSimulatedCmdPort\n\n\n## Non-standard functions\n\n@docs isLoaded, isConnected, getKeyUrl, willAutoReopen, setAutoReopen\n@docs filterResponses, isReconnectedResponse, reconnectedResponses\n\n\n## Internal, exposed only for tests\n\n@docs encode, decode\n\n",

It is generated only when you send messages while the connection is down, causing them to be queued up. It may contain one or more `ReconnectedResponse` instances, so if you care about that, you should call `reconnectedResponses` to extract them.\n\n`ConnectedResponse` tells you that an earlier call to `send` or `keepAlive` has successfully connected. You can usually ignore this.\n\n`ReconnectedResponse` is sent when the connection to the server has been re-established after being lost. If you need to re-establish logical connections after losing the physical connection, you'll need to pay attention to this. Otherwise, you can safely ignore it.\n\n`MessageReceivedResponse` is a message from one of the connected sockets.\n\n`ClosedResponse` tells you that an earlier call to `close` has completed. Its `code`, `reason`, and `wasClean` fields are as passed by the JavaScript `WebSocket` interface. Its `expected` field will be `True`, if the response is to a `close` call on your part. It will be `False` if the close was unexpected, and reconnection attempts failed for 20 seconds (using exponential backoff between attempts).\n\n`ErrorResponse` means that something went wrong.
