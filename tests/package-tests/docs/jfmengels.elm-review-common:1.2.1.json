Looking at the error reports (using `elm-review --unsuppress`\nfor instance) will give you the more precise problems and locations.\n\n\n## Recommendations\n\nI recommend making it extra explicit when deprecating elements in your application code, for instance by renaming\ndeprecated elements to include \"deprecated\" in their name, or in their module name for modules.\n\nThat way, it will be very explicit for you and your teammates when you're using something that is deprecated, even in\nGit diffs.\n\nFor packages, renaming something is a breaking chance so that is not a viable option (if it is, remove the function and\nrelease a new major version). Instead, what you can do is to start a line in your module/value/type's documentation\nwith `@deprecated`. There is no official nor conventional approach around deprecation in the Elm community, but this may\nbe a good start. But definitely pitch in the discussion around making a standard!\n(I'll put a link here soon. If I haven't, please remind me!)\n\nFor both application and packages, when you deprecate something, I highly recommend documenting (in the most appropriate\nlocation) why it is deprecate but especially what alternatives should be used or explored. It can be frustrating to\nlearn that something is deprecated without an explanation or any guidance what to use instead.\n\n@docs Configuration, defaults, dependencies, withExceptionsForElements\n\n\n## Fail\n\n    import DeprecatedModule\n\n    a =\n        DeprecatedModule.view \"...\"\n\n    b =\n        Button.view_DEPRECATED \"Click me!\" OnClick\n\n\n## When (not) to enable this rule\n\nIf you do not have deprecated elements in your project, this rule won't be useful.\n\n\n## Try it out\n\nYou can try this rule out by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nelm-review --template jfmengels/elm-review-common/example --rules NoDeprecated\n```\n\n",
