When there are multiple ports with the same name you may encounter a JavaScript runtime error.\n\nIt is common practice to have a single `Ports` module to contain all of the ports in a project. The `Ports` module can then be imported anywhere that needs access to a port.\n\n\n## When (not) to use this rule\n\nPorts are not allowed in Elm packages - you should not enable this when developing an Elm package.\n\n\n## Try it out\n\nYou can try this rule out by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nelm-review --template sparksp/elm-review-ports/example --rules NoDuplicatePorts\n```\n\n",

We can prevent this by just wrapping the incoming data as `Json.Encode.Value` and handling the data through a [`Decoder`][Json.Decode] instead. This guarantees that your application provides some sort of error handling. This is discussed in the Elm guide under [Verifying Flags].\n\n[Json.Decode]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode\n[Verifying Flags]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/flags.html#verifying-flags\n\n\n## Success\n\n    port action : (Json.Decode.Value -> msg) -> Sub msg\n\n    port alarm : Json.Encode.Value -> Cmd msg\n\n\n## Failure\n\n    port action : (Int -> msg) -> Sub msg\n\n    port alarm : String -> Cmd msg\n\n\n## Caveats\n\n  - Outgoing ports must accept a `Value` from `Json.Encode` or `Json.Decode` and result in a `Cmd`.\n  - Incoming ports must expect a `Value` from `Json.Encode` or `Json.Decode` and result in a `Sub`.\n  - The rule looks for the types `Cmd`, `Sub` and `Value` only - do not alias these types.\n\n\n## Try it out\n\nYou can try this rule out by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nelm-review --template sparksp/elm-review-ports/example --rules NoUnsafePorts\n```\n\n",

When a port is unused it will not be present in the compiled JavaScript, and when no ports are used the `app.ports` object will be `undefined`.
