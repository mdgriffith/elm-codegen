You'll need to define:\n\n1.  **how it acts**, using things like [`withLocation`](#withLocation) and\n    [`withDirection`](#withDirection).\n2.  **what it looks like**, which you'll provide in the type parameter to\n    [`Particle`](#Particle).\n\nFor example, maybe you want to show some confetti when a student finishes a\nquiz. Hooray! Time to celebrate! 🎉 🎊 We'll model each little piece as having\nboth a color and a shape, like this:\n\n    type alias Confetti =\n        { color : Color -- Red, Green, Blue\n        , shape : Shape -- Square, Star, Streamer\n        }\n\nThen a `Particle` of confetti—just one of those little pieces—would be `Particle\nConfetti`. Boring, but in the best way possible! Now, we _could_ construct our\nconfetti by hand, like this:\n\n    { color = Red, shape = Square }\n\n… but that's boring! Not only do we have to do every piece we want by hand, but\nsince all functions in Elm are pure we will never get any variation! Boo!\nInstead, we'll generate Confetti randomly using [`elm/random`][random]. If you\nhaven't used this package before, check out [The Elm Guide's explanation][teg],\nor [Chandrika Achar's appearance on Elm Town][chandrika-achar]. We'll use\n`Random.map2` and `Random.uniform` to generate particles of a random color and\nshape:\n\n  - `Random.uniform` takes a bunch of items, and chooses between them evenly.\n  - `Random.map2` takes the random stuff you generate, and gives it as two\n    arguments to a function.\n\nThe code ends up looking like this:\n\n    confetti : Random.Generator Confetti\n    confetti =\n        Random.map2 Confetti\n            (Random.uniform Red [ Green, Blue ])\n            (Random.uniform Square [ Star, Streamer ])\n\nSo that's the data for rendering your particles, but how do you get them to\nbehave how you like? When using `Particle`, you'll create a particle with\n[`init`](#init), and then use functions like [`withLocation`](#withLocation) and\n[`withDirection`](#withDirection) to define that. Read on for what they do!\n\nYou should also read the documentation on `Particle.System` for a managed way to\nrender these—you don't have to worry about animation yourself!\n\nOne last thing before we get into the documentation in earnest: this page only\nscratches the surface of what you can do with particle generators. There are a\nfew fully-worked-out and documented examples in the [`examples`][examples]\nfolder of the source on GitHub. Go check those out!\n\n[teg]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/random.html\n[random]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/\n[chandrika-achar]: https://elmtown.simplecast.fm/randomness-chandrika\n[examples]: https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-particle/tree/master/examples\n\n\n# Constructing Particles\n\n@docs Particle, init, withLifetime, withDelay, withLocation, withDirection, withSpeed, withGravity, withDrag\n\n\n# Rendering Particles\n\n@docs view, viewHtml, data, lifetimePercent, lifetime, direction, directionDegrees, speed, leftPixels, topPixels\n\n\n# Simulation\n\n@docs update\n\n",

You'll have to tweak these numbers to get something you like; here's\nwhat they mean:\n\n  - **density** is the density of whatever fluid the particles are in. The\n    higher this is, the more particles will be slowed down. Think about trying\n    to run on land versus in the water—you're slowed down much more by the water\n    than the air, and you experience more resistance the faster you try to\n    move. Air will be around 0.001275 (g/cm³). Water will be around 1.\n\n  - **area** is the area of the front surface. For a square, that'd be the side\n    facing into the flow. The bigger this is, the more drag happens. When\n    setting this, remember that this is a 2-dimensional simulation, so you\n    mostly just provide a single dimension's length! In a _real_ simulation,\n    we'd calculate this on every frame to account for rotation. But we can get\n    acceptable results without that, so it's fine to just give a rough number\n    here!\n\n  - **coefficient** is how easily air/water/whatever flows over the surface\n    facing into the flow. A higher number means that you will face more\n    resistance. [Wikipedia][coefficients] has a nice chart of sample\n    coefficients for various surface shapes; choosing one of those will probably\n    get you most of the way there.\n\nThis function is a bit different from others because it's really convenient to\nbe able to generate whatever kind of particle and set drag separately.

So maybe you want to turn a\nstream of water on and off, or control the pressure? That's great! You can store\nthose parameters in your model, and use them to make your generators.\n\nEach emitter gets the time since the last frame in milliseconds so that it can\ncalculate how many particles to emit. So, for example, a water emitter that\nemitted 60 drops per second may look like this:\n\n    waterEmitter : Float -> Generator (List (Particle Droplet))\n    waterEmitter delta =\n        Random.list (ceiling (delta * (60 / 1000))) dropletGenerator\n\nThen you'd use this in your subscription like this:\n\n    sub [ waterEmitter ] ParticleMsg model.system\n\nIf this doesn't make sense, go read the [`Water.elm`][water] example, which ties\nall of this together.\n\n[water]: https://brianhicks.github.io/elm-particle/Water.html\n\n",
