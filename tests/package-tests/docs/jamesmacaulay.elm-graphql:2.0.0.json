The type should have a single constructor that takes no arguments, and both should have the CamelCase name of the custom scalar type in the GraphQL schema, plus a `\"Type\"` suffix. For example, if your GraphQL schema has a `Time` type, you should define your `customTypeMarker` like the following, in some module of your choosing:\n\n    type TimeType\n        = TimeType\n\nThe type marker is used by this package to help make sure `ValueSpec`s are only combined in valid ways.

This function is intended to start a pipeline of calls to the `with` function to add field and fragment selections to the `ValueSpec`. The order of arguments to the constructor function determines the order that the selections must be added. For example:\n\n    type alias User =\n        { name : String\n        , isAdmin : Bool\n        }\n\n    userSummary : ValueSpec NonNull ObjectType User vars\n    userSummary =\n        object User\n            |> with (field \"name\" [] string)\n            |> with (field \"isAdmin\" [] bool)\n\nThe above `ValueSpec` produces a GraphQL selection set that looks like the following:\n\n    {\n      name\n      isAdmin\n    }\n\nThe same `ValueSpec` also provides a JSON decoder for decoding part of the response, equivalent to the following:\n\n    Json.Decode.map2 User\n        (Json.Decode.field \"name\" Json.Decode.string)\n        (Json.Decode.field \"isAdmin\" Json.Decode.bool)\n\n",

If you pass a `NonNull` `VariableSpec` into this function, it just means that you won't be able to represent an explicit `null` for the variable's value. If instead you pass a `Nullable` `VariableSpec` into this function, you will be able to represent an explicit `null` value for the variable, but you'll also have to deal with double-wrapped `Maybe` values – a missing value is then represented as a `Nothing` returned from your extraction function, and a `null` value is represented as `Just Nothing`.

If the `VariableSpec` is `NonNull`, then the extracted value is wrapped in a single `Maybe` as described above. If it is `Nullable`, then a double-Maybe-wrapped value is extracted from the variables value. In this case, `Nothing` indicates that the field should be omitted, `Just Nothing` indicates an explicit `null` value, and `Just (Just x)` indicates a regular non-null value. In both cases, this function should never be used with fields of input objects that have been defined as non-null by the schema.\n\nIn the following example, both the `phoneNumber` and `email` fields are optional. However, only the `phoneNumber` field may be assigned an explicit `null` value (represented by `Just Nothing`):\n\n    type alias UpdateUserInputData =\n        { id : String\n        , email : Maybe String\n        , phoneNumber : Maybe (Maybe String)\n        }\n\n    userDataVar : Variable { vars | userData : UpdateUserInputData }\n    userDataVar =\n        required \"userData\"\n            .userData\n            (object \"UpdateUserInput\"\n                [ field \"id\" .id id\n                , optionalField \"email\" .email string\n                , optionalField \"phoneNumber\" .phoneNumber (nullable string)\n                ]\n            )\n",
