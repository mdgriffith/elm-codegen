                "comment": " Manually transform a shape using a `Transform` matrix. Matrix multiplication will\nbe used to apply the given matrix to any transformations of the current\nshape. This is designed to be used in the usual way in a pipe:\n\n```\ncircle 10\n    |> filled red\n    |> transform moveLeft50\n\nmoveLeft50 =\n    ident\n        |> moveT (50,0)\n```\n\nNOTE: Transformations generated using pipes this way are applied backwards compared\nto the \"regular\" `Shape userMsg` transformation functions. For example, `rect0` and\n`rect1` below are equivalent:\n\n```\nmyTransform =\n    ident\n        |> scaleT 2 2\n        |> rotateT (degrees 30)\n        |> moveT (0, 50)\n\nrect0 =\n    rect 20 10\n        |> filled red\n        |> transform myTransform\n\nrect1 =\n    rect 20 10\n        |> filled red\n        |> move (0, 50)\n        |> rotate (degrees 30)\n        |> scale 2\n```\n\nOn the other hand, single transformations produce a result consistent with the\n`Shape userMsg` transformations. `rect2` is also equivalent to the two above:\n\n```\nmoveRight50 =\n    ident\n        |> moveT (50,0)\n\nscale2 =\n    ident\n        |> scaleT 2 2\n\nrotate30 =\n    ident\n        |> rotateT (degrees 30)\n\nrect2 =\n    rect 20 10\n        |> filled red\n        |> transform moveRight50\n        |> transform scale2\n        |> transform rotate30\n```\n\nHowever, chaining together transformations in this way is discouraged because\nit is less efficient than the regular `Shape userMsg` transformations in\nthe \"Transformations\" section.\n\n",
