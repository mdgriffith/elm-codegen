It works by approximation, drawing many small straight lines along a curved path. Its first parameter, an `Int`, is the resolution of the curve (resolution=1 will be just a straight line, and higher values will compute a more perfect curve). The remaining parameters are `Position`. The first and last `Position` refer to the starting and ending points of the curve. The middle two are control points, which are where the curve will curve towards from each end point.\n\n    squiggle : Int -> List Position\n    squiggle i =\n        Raster (i // 2)\n            (Position 0 0)\n            (Position i 0)\n            (Position 0 i)\n            (Position i i)\n\n",
