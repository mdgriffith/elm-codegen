        "comment": " A datatype representing fetched data.\n\nIf you find yourself continually using `Maybe (Result Error a)` to\nrepresent loaded data, or you have a habit of shuffling errors away to\nwhere they can be quietly ignored, consider using this. It makes it\neasier to represent the real state of a remote data fetch and handle\nit properly.\n\nFor more on the motivation, take a look at the blog post [How Elm Slays A UI Antipattern](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/how-elm-slays-a-ui-antipattern.html).\n\nTo use the datatype, let's look at an example that loads `News` from a feed.\n\nFirst you add to your model, wrapping the data you want in `WebData`:\n\n    type alias Model =\n        { news : WebData News }\n\nThen add in a message that will deliver the response:\n\n    type Msg\n        = NewsResponse (WebData News)\n\nNow we can create an HTTP get:\n\n    getNews : Cmd Msg\n    getNews =\n        Http.get\n            { url = \"/news\"\n            , expect = expectJson (RemoteData.fromResult >> NewsResponse) decodeNews\n            }\n\nWe trigger it in our `init` function:\n\n    init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )\n    init =\n        ( { news = Loading }\n        , getNews\n        )\n\nWe handle it in our `update` function:\n\n    update msg model =\n        case msg of\n            NewsResponse response ->\n                ( { model | news = response }\n                , Cmd.none\n                )\n\nMost of this you'd already have in your app, and the changes are just\nwrapping the datatype in `Webdata`, and converting the Result from\n`Http.get`/`Http.post`/`Http.request` to RemoteData with `RemoteData.fromResult`.\n\nNow we get to where we really want to be, rendering the data and\nhandling the different states in the UI gracefully:\n\n    view : Model -> Html msg\n    view model =\n      case model.news of\n        NotAsked -> text \"Initialising.\"\n\n        Loading -> text \"Loading.\"\n\n        Failure err -> text (\"Error: \" ++ toString err)\n\n        Success news -> viewNews news\n\n\n    viewNews : News -> Html msg\n    viewNews news =\n        div []\n            [h1 [] [text \"Here is the news.\"]\n            , ...]\n\nAnd that's it. A more accurate model of what's happening leads to a better UI.\n\n@docs RemoteData\n@docs WebData\n@docs map\n@docs map2\n@docs map3\n@docs andMap\n@docs succeed\n@docs mapError\n@docs mapBoth\n@docs fromTask\n@docs andThen\n@docs withDefault\n@docs unwrap\n@docs unpack\n@docs fromMaybe\n@docs fromResult\n@docs toMaybe\n@docs asCmd\n@docs append\n@docs fromList\n@docs isSuccess\n@docs isFailure\n@docs isLoading\n@docs isNotAsked\n@docs update\n@docs prism\n\n",

It is\nstill `Loading` if _any_ of its children are still `Loading`. And if\nany child fails, the error is the leftmost `Failure` value.\n\nNote that this provides a general pattern for `map2`, `map3`, ..,\n`mapN`. If you find yourself wanting `map4` or `map5`, just use:\n\n    foo f a b c d e =\n        map f a\n            |> andMap b\n            |> andMap c\n            |> andMap d\n            |> andMap e\n\nIt's a general recipe that doesn't require us to ever have the\ndiscussion, \"Could you just add `map7`? Could you just add `map8`?\nCould you just...\".\n\nCategory theory points: This is `apply` with the arguments flipped.\n\n",
