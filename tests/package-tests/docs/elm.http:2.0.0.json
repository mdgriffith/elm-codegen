The implementation\nclamps the fraction between `0.0` and `1.0`, so you will just get `1.0` if\nyou ever receive more bytes than promised.\n\n**Note:** If you are streaming something, you can write a custom version of\nthis function that just tracks bytes received. Maybe you show that 22kb or 83kb\nhave been downloaded, without a specific fraction.

It can be useful if `www.example.com` needs to\ntalk to `uploads.example.com`, but it should be used very carefully!\n\nFor example, every HTTP request includes a `Host` header revealing the domain,\nso any request to `facebook.com` reveals the website that sent it. From there,\ncookies can be used to correlate browsing habits with specific users. “Oh, it\nlooks like they visited `example.com`. Maybe they want ads about examples!”\nThis is why you can get shoe ads for months without saying anything about it\non any social networks. **This risk exists even for people who do not have an\naccount.** Servers can set a new cookie to uniquely identify the browser and\nbuild a profile around that.
