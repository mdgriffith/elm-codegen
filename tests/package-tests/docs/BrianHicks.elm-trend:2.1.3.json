If your data form a rough line, we're in business. But if\nyour plot shows a curve or a random point cloud then don't trust the\nresults you get from these functions. (n.b. check out\n`terezka/elm-plot`, which makes this very easy!)\n\nSome kinds of data which fit these criteria:\n\n  - the relationship between some value and time. For example, are\n    bananas getting cheaper or more expensive as time goes on? Does\n    running something twice take exactly twice as long as running it\n    once?\n  - Big sociological questions: does an increase in healthcare\n    spending lead to longer life expectancy?
