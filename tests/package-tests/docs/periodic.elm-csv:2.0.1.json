There are two major deviations assumed in this library.\n\n1.  The `\\n` or `\\r` character may be used instead of `\\r\\n` for line separators.\n2.  The trailing new-line may be omitted.\n\nRFC 4180 grammar, for reference, with notes.\n\nThe trailing newline is required, but we'll make it optional.\n\n    file =\n        [ header CRLF ] record * CRLF record [ CRLF ]\n\n    header =\n        name * COMMA name\n\n    record =\n        field * COMMA field\n\n    name =\n        field\n\n    field =\n        escaped / non - escaped\n\nThere is no room for spaces around the quotes. The specification is that\n\n    escaped =\n        DQUOTE * (TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2 DQUOTE) DQUOTE\n\nIn this specification, fields that don't have quotes surrounding them cannot have a quote inside them because it is excluded from `TEXTDATA`.\n\n    non-escaped = *TEXTDATA\n    COMMA = %x2C\n    CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]\n    DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]\n    LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]\n\nThe spec requires that new lines be `CR + LF` but we'll let them get away with just `LF` if they want..\n\n    CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]\n\nAll the printable characters minus the double-quote and comma, this is important above.\n\n    TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E\n\n\n# Types\n\n@docs Csv\n\n\n# Functions\n\n@docs parse\n@docs parseWith\n\n",
