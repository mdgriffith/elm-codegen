If you are doing both, you want both kinds of tolerance,\nor to split the calculation into smaller parts for testing.\n\n\n### Absolute Tolerance\n\nLet's say we want to figure out if our estimation of pi is precise enough.\n\nIs `3.14` within `0.01` of `pi`? Yes, because `3.13 < pi < 3.15`.\n\n    test \"3.14 approximates pi with absolute precision\" <|\n        \\_ ->\n            3.14 |> Expect.within (Absolute 0.01) pi\n\n\n### Relative Tolerance\n\nWhat if we also want to know if our circle circumference estimation is close enough?\n\nLet's say our circle has a radius of `r` meters. The formula for circle circumference is `C=2*r*pi`.\nTo make the calculations a bit easier ([ahem](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto)), we'll look at half the circumference; `C/2=r*pi`.\nIs `r * 3.14` within `0.01` of `r * pi`?\nThat depends, what does `r` equal? If `r` is `0.01`mm, or `0.00001` meters, we're comparing\n`0.00001 * 3.14 - 0.01 < r * pi < 0.00001 * 3.14 + 0.01` or `-0.0099686 < 0.0000314159 < 0.0100314`.\nThat's a huge tolerance! A circumference that is _a thousand times longer_ than we expected would pass that test!\n\nOn the other hand, if `r` is very large, we're going to need many more digits of pi.\nFor an absolute tolerance of `0.01` and a pi estimation of `3.14`, this expectation only passes if `r < 2*pi`.\n\nIf we use a relative tolerance of `0.01` instead, the circle area comparison becomes much better. Is `r * 3.14` within\n`1%` of `r * pi`? Yes! In fact, three digits of pi approximation is always good enough for a 0.1% relative tolerance,\nas long as `r` isn't [too close to zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number).\n\n    fuzz\n        (floatRange 0.000001 100000)\n        \"Circle half-circumference with relative tolerance\"\n        (\\r -> r * 3.14 |> Expect.within (Relative 0.001) (r * pi))\n\n\n### Trouble with Numbers Near Zero\n\nIf you are adding things near zero, you probably want absolute tolerance. If you're comparing values between `-1` and `1`, you should consider using absolute tolerance.\n\nFor example: Is `1 + 2 - 3` within `1%` of `0`? Well, if `1`, `2` and `3` have any amount of rounding error, you might not get exactly zero. What is `1%` above and below `0`? Zero. We just lost all tolerance. Even if we hard-code the numbers, we might not get exactly zero; `0.1 + 0.2` rounds to a value just above `0.3`, since computers, counting in binary, cannot write down any of those three numbers using a finite number of digits, just like we cannot write `0.333...` exactly in base 10.\n\nAnother example is comparing values that are on either side of zero. `0.0001` is more than `100%` away from `-0.0001`. In fact, `infinity` is closer to `0.0001` than `0.0001` is to `-0.0001`, if you are using a relative tolerance. Twice as close, actually. So even though both `0.0001` and `-0.0001` could be considered very close to zero, they are very far apart relative to each other. The same argument applies for any number of zeroes.\n\n",

When a test fails on one of those random\nvalues, the shrinker takes the failing value and makes it smaller/simpler for\nyou so you can guess more easily what property of that value caused the test\nto fail.\n\nShrinking is a way to try and find the \"smallest\", \"simplest\" example that\nfails, in order to give the tester better feedback on what went wrong.\n\nShrinkers are functions that, given a failing value, offer \"smaller\", \"simpler\"\nvalues to test against.\n\n\n### What is \"small\" (or \"simple\")?\n\nThat's kind of arbitrary, and depends on what kind of values you're fuzzing.\nWhen you write your own Shrinker, you decide what is small for the kind of data\nyou're testing with.\n\nLet's say I'm writing a Fuzzer for binary trees:\n\n    -- randomly-generated binary trees might soon become unreadable\n    type Tree a\n        = Node (Tree a) (Tree a)\n        | Leaf a\n\nNow let's say its random Generator produced the following tree that makes the\ntest fail:\n\n    Node\n        (Node\n            (Node\n                (Node\n                    (Leaf 888)\n                    (Leaf 9090)\n                )\n                (Node\n                    (Leaf -1)\n                    (Node\n                        (Leaf 731)\n                        (Node\n                            (Leaf 9621)\n                            (Leaf -12)\n                        )\n                    )\n                )\n            )\n            (Node\n                (Leaf -350)\n                (Leaf 124)\n            )\n        )\n        (Node\n            (Leaf 45)\n            (Node\n                (Leaf 123)\n                (Node\n                    (Leaf 999111)\n                    (Leaf -148148)\n                )\n            )\n        )\n\nThis is a pretty big tree, there are many nodes and leaves, and it's difficult\nto tell which is responsible for the failing. If we don't attempt to shrink it,\nthe developer will have a hard time pointing out why it fails.\n\nNow let's pass it through a shrinker, and test the resulting value until we find\nthis new value that still fails the test:\n\n    Leaf -1\n\nNice, looks like a negative number in a `Leaf` could be the issue.\n\n\n### How does shrinking work?\n\nA shrinker takes a value and returns a short list of smaller values.\n\nOnce elm-test finds a failing fuzz test, it tries to shrink the input using\nthe shrinker. We'll then try the smaller values as inputs to that test. If one\nof the smaller values also fail, we continue shrinking from there instead.\nOnce the shrinker says that there are no smaller values, or no smaller values\nfail the fuzz test, we stop shrinking.\n\nIt's helpful to think of Shrinkers as returning simpler values rather than\nsmaller values. For example, 1 is smaller/simpler than 47142, and -1 is\nsmaller/simpler than -47142.\n\nWhether or not the shrunken value is actually smaller isn't that important,\nas long as we aren't shrinking in a loop. The bool shrinker shrinks True to\nFalse, but not vice versa. If it did, and your test failed no matter if this\nvariable was True or False, there would always be a smaller/simpler value, so\nwe'd never stop shrinking! We would just re-test the same values over and over\nagain, forever!\n\n\n### How do I make my own Shrinkers?\n\nShrinkers are deterministic, since they do not have access to a random number\ngenerator. It's the generator part of the fuzzer that's meant to find the rare\nedge cases; it's the shrinkers job to make the failures as understandable as\npossible.\n\nShrinkers have to return a LazyList, something that works a bit like a list.\nThat LazyList may or may not have another element each time we ask for one,\nand doesn't necessarily have them all committed to memory. That allows it to\ntake less space (interesting since there may be quite a lot of elements).\n\nThat LazyList should also provide a finite number of shrunk values (if it\nprovided an infinite number of them, tests using it might continue indefinitely\nat the shrinking phase).\n\nShrinkers must never shrink values in a circle, like:\n\n    loopinBooleanShrinker True == [ False ]\n\n    loopinBooleanShrinker False == [ True ]\n\nDoing so will also result in tests looping indefinitely, testing and re-testing\nthe same values in a circle.\n\n",

Instead, use\nit when you want to focus on getting a particular subset of your tests to\npass. If you use `skip`, your entire test suite will fail, even if\neach of the individual tests pass. This is to help avoid accidentally\ncommitting a `skip` to version control.\n\nSee also [`only`](#only).
