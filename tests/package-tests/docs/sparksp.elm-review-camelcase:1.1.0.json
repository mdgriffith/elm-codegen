Read the notes below and make sure that you and your team are 100% happy to adopt this for your codebase!\n\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n\n### Camel Case\n\nVariable and constant names must be formatted in **camelCase**, such that each word in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation. This includes all variables, function names and arguments, and port names.\n\n  - A single underscore at the end of a token is allowed (used for masking variables), but multiple trailing underscores will be squashed.\n      - Pass: `model_`\n      - Fail: `model___` => `model_`\n  - Single-letter words and abbreviations are accepted.\n      - Pass: `hasAThing`\n      - Pass: `toHTML`\n  - We consider any numbers to be the end of a word.\n      - Pass: `person1`\n      - Fail: `address_1stLine` => `address1StLine` (note the `St`)\n      - Fail: `one_two3four_five` => `oneTwo3FourFive` (note the `Four`)\n\n\n### Pascal Case\n\nModule and type names must be formatted in **PascalCase**, such that each word of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation.\n\n  - Single-letter words and abbreviations are accepted.\n      - Pass: `HasAThing`\n      - Pass: `ToHTML`\n  - We take CONSTANT\\_CASE parts as whole words.\n      - Fail: `CONSTANT_CASE` => `ConstantCase`\n      - Fail: `TO_HTML` => `ToHtml`\n  - We consider any numbers to be the end of a word.\n      - Pass: `Person1`\n      - Fail: `Person_1` => `Person1`\n      - Fail: `Address_1stLine` => `Address1StLine` (note the `St`)\n      - Fail: `One_Two3four_Five` => `OneTwo3FourFive` (note the `Four`)\n\n\n### Unknown suggestion\n\nIf the converter fails to parse a term it will suggest \"Unknown\" as the replacement. We're confident that this will not happen, so if you encounter this please [report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sparksp/elm-review-camelcase/issues) so we can take a look.\n\n",
