        "comment": " A type for validating a form, collecting errors as we go.\n\nImagine you have a type that represents the data a user has currently\nentered into a form. For example, maybe it looks like this:\n\n    type alias FormData =\n        { username : String\n        , password : String\n        , confirmPassword : String\n        }\n\nYou want to validate it into a user object:\n\n    type alias User =\n        { username : String\n        , password : String\n        }\n\nWhen we build up our user type, even one bad field is enough to fail\nthe validation. But when we display the invalid form, we want to show\nthe problems for every single field, not just the first bad one. So\nwhen validation doesn't succeed, you want to produce a `FormErrors`:\n\n    type UsernameError\n        = UsernameMissing\n\n    type PasswordError\n        = PasswordNotStrongEnough\n        | PasswordsDontMatch\n\n    type alias FormErrors =\n        { username : Maybe UsernameError\n        , password : Maybe PasswordError\n        , confirmPassword : Maybe PasswordError\n        }\n\nWe want to stop building the User as soon as we get one failed field,\nso you could try using `Maybe.Extra.andMap`:\n\n    validateUser : FormData -> Maybe User\n    validateUser state =\n        Just (\\username password _ -> User username password)\n            |> MaybeEx.andMap (checkStringEmpty state.username)\n            |> MaybeEx.andMap (checkPasswordStrength state.password)\n            |> MaybeEx.andMap (checkMatch state.password state.confirmPassword)\n\nBut then what if the user was Nothing? You have to re-use all those\nfield checks and even invert them to produce errors instead of\nsuccesses so that you can use them in the `FormErrors` type.\n\n`FormResult` solves this problem by building up both the error type\nand the validated \"output\" type at the same time. You feed it\n`Result`s and it feeds `Err`s to the error type and `Ok`s to the\n\"output\" type. After all the fields have been provided, you can\nconvert the whole thing into a `Result`, which will be `Ok` if all the\nfields were `Ok`, or `Err` otherwise.\n\n    validateUsername : String -> Either UsernameError String\n    validateUsername s =\n        if s == \"\" then Err UsernameMissing else Ok s\n\n    validatePassword : String -> Either PasswordError String\n    validatePassword s = ...\n\n    validateMatch : String -> String -> Either PasswordError String\n    validateMatch password confirmPassword = ...\n\n    validateUser : FormData -> Either FormErrors User\n    validateUser state =\n        Form.Result.start FormErrors User\n            |> Form.Result.validate (validateUsername state.username)\n            |> Form.Result.validate (validatePassword state.password)\n            |> Form.Result.checkErr (validateMatch state.password state.confirmPassword)\n            |> Form.Result.toResult\n\nNote that although `state.confirmPassword` does not contribute\nanything to our output type, we still need to check it for errors, and\nany errors in it should cause the validation to fail.\n\nA fully-functioning demo can be found in the\n[examples](https://github.com/glasserc/elm-form-result/tree/master/examples)\ndirectory in [this project's\nrepository](https://github.com/glasserc/elm-form-result).\n\n\n## Hints\n\n  - `FormResult` is easiest to use if the order of fields in your error\n    type corresponds to the order of fields in your output type. (Your\n    form state type and generated HTML can be in any order you like, of\n    course.) If you have to feed fields to your output type and your\n    error type in a different order, you can do that using\n    `maybeValid` and `maybeErr`, but it's easy to get confused.\n\n  - If you find yourself with a `FormResult` that has a lot of fields\n    and you're losing track of what field belongs to what output type,\n    you might consider splitting up your validation function into\n    smaller validation functions, producing smaller types. For an\n    example of this, check `validateFraction` in [the\n    example](https://github.com/glasserc/elm-form-result/blob/master/examples/src/Main.elm).\n\n@docs FormResult, start, validated, toResult\n@docs maybeValid, maybeErr\n@docs checkErr, ifMissing, missingAs\n@docs unconditional, unconditionalErr\n\n",

You'd augment the form with any errors you produced, and as the\nuser updated the form, you would clear the error fields (until you\nvalidated it again).\n\nYou have a submit button but you want to disable it if there's an\nerror that needs correcting, so you add a `disabled` attribute\naccording to the condition `Maybe.isJust formErrors`. But eventually\nthe user will clear the last error and you'll have a FormError full of\n`Nothing`s. You need to convert that `Just` \"empty\" FormError into a\n`Nothing` so that the submit button can be activated again.\n\nYou could write a function like this:\n\n    flatten : FormErrors -> Maybe FormErrors\n    flatten ({ password, acceptedTerms } as formErrors) =\n        case ( password, acceptedTerms ) of\n            ( Nothing, Nothing ) ->\n                Nothing\n\n            _ ->\n                Just formErrors\n\nBut this function is brittle. If you add a field to the `FormErrors`\ntype, this function needs to be updated too, and the compiler won't\nhelp you.\n\nInstead, this module provides an `AnyJust` type that re-uses the\nconstructor to your `FormErrors` type to ensure that every field is\nchecked for presence. You could re-write the `flatten` function with\nit as:\n\n    flatten : FormErrors -> Maybe FormErrors\n    flatten formErrors =\n        AnyJust.start FormErorrs\n            |> AnyJust.check formErrors.password\n            |> AnyJust.check formErrors.acceptedTerms\n            |> AnyJust.finish\n\nAs the name implies, if any field is `Just`, then at the end, you wind\nup with a `Just FormErrors` (produced by re-constructing it with the\nvalues given). If no `Just` was provided to `AnyJust.check`, then you\nend up with `Nothing`. The reconstruction of the `FormErrors` is\nslightly inefficient, but in exchage, we can leverage the compiler to\ncomplain if we add another field.\n\n@docs AnyJust, start, check, finish, map, andMap, andThen\n\n",
